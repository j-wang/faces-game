Faces Game
=========
Overview
---------
Simple faces game. Presents user with a picture and a set of choices of
names. The goal is to pick the correct name for the face.

The game will show you whether or not you are correct and what you should ask
that person about (their listed skills)!


Goal
--------
This game was primarily my own learning about web protocols, web coding,
templating, and scraping.

Hopefully it'll also help me learn everyone's names too (and maybe even help
others).


Implemented Concepts
---------
- Login to Hacker School website using mechanize
- Styling using Twitter Bootstrap
- Web coding in Python using flask
- Templating using Jinja2
- Web scraping using lxml/beautifulsoup and xpaths
- Web scraping using scrapy (ultimately replaced with lxml/beautifulsoup)
- Basic web understanding (learning more about GET, POST requests, forms)



To-dos
---------
- Caching
- Security considerations
- Other game mechanics (different difficulties, pulling in bios, etc.)
